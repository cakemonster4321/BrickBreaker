# 🏀BrickBreaker

## 📄Intro

Hello! I'm a sophomore from NUKIM. This is a small BrickBreaker game I built using python.   
Since the best way to learn a language is by making a project.  
I've been working on this for a month.My current goal is to add more features to it.  
Maybe the game is going to be a rogue-like game.  
I always find it funny play those kind of games, and BrickBreaker is probably a good way to implement it.  
I hope you find my game interesting and maybe you can leave a star. If there's something wrong please inform me or create a pull request.  


你好! 我是高雄大學資管系大二學生。 這個brickBreaker是為了學習python語法所以練習用的小遊戲
從0開始寫，開始到結束出現了很多想法，所以程式非常雜亂，請見諒，如果覺得這個小遊戲有趣的話麻煩幫我留個start 甘溫!!

Best regards.
