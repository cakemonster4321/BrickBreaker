# 🏀BrickBreaker

## 📄Intro

Hello! This is a small BrickBreaker game I built using python.   
Since the best way to learn a language is by making a project.  
I've been working on.My current goal is to add more features to it.  
Maybe the game is going to be a rogue-like game.  
I always find it funny play those kind of games, and BrickBreaker is probably a good way to implement it.  
I hope you find my game interesting and maybe you can leave a star(?). If there's something wrong please inform me or create a pull request.  

Best regards.
