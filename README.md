# BrickBreaker

# Intro

Hello! This is a small BrickBreaker game I built using python. 
Since the best way to learn a language is by making a project. 
I've been working on.My current goal is to add more features to it.
Maybe the game is going to be a rogue-like game. 
I always find it funny play those kind of games, and BrickBreaker is probably a good way to implement it.
I hope you find my game interesting and maybe you can leave a star(?). If there's something wrong please inform me or create a pull request.

Best regards.
